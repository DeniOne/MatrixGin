# Memory Bank Entry: MVP Learning Contour Refactor & Manual

**Date**: 2026-01-23
**Module**: 06-MVP-LEARNING-CONTOUR
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Summary
Completed a comprehensive refactoring of the MVP Learning Contour to version v1.1 and created a scenario-based user manual (v1.2).

### Key Achievements
1.  **Documentation Alignment**: Updated all 9 core documents to reflect the "Dual-Interface" architecture (Web + Telegram), removing outdated restrictions on Web UI and Analytics.
2.  **Readiness Assessment**: Confirmed pilot readiness for Employee Registration (Personnel), Content Prep (Registry), and Learning (University).
3.  **User Manual**: Created `09-MVP-GUIDE-RU.md` — a segmented, role-based guide covering physical scenarios for Students, Trainers, and Admins.
    *   **Strict Scope**: Explicitly excludes ERP/Store features.
    *   **Ethical Guardrails**: Qualitative description of MC economy and Anti-Fraud logic.

## Next Steps
- Begin pilot user registration (`/api/registration/invite`).
- Populate Academy content via Registry or API.
- Monitor Security Dashboard for first signals.
