# MatrixGin — Change Gatekeeping Framework

This layer defines mandatory gates for admitting changes into the system.

Gatekeeping exists to:
- protect system integrity,
- enforce validation layers,
- eliminate subjective approvals,
- enable safe scaling and outsourcing.

No change enters MatrixGin without passing its required gates.
