# MatrixGin — Outsource Gates

A task MAY be outsourced only if:

1. Scope is strictly defined.
2. Affected modules have contracts.
3. Forbidden zones are documented.
4. Acceptance criteria are explicit.
5. Validation responsibilities are assigned.

Outsourcing without these conditions is considered a system risk.
