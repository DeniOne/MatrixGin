# MatrixGin — Functional Validation Layer

This layer validates system behavior through real-world use cases
and explicitly forbidden scenarios.

Functional validation exists to:
- protect business logic,
- enforce governance rules,
- detect non-obvious logical regressions.

Passing unit or contract tests does NOT guarantee functional correctness.
