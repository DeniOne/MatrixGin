# MatrixGin — Technical Validation Layer

This layer verifies correctness of code execution.

It exists to:
- prevent regressions,
- validate edge cases,
- protect refactoring.

Technical validation does NOT validate:
- system intent,
- business authority,
- architectural correctness.

Passing this layer alone is insufficient for system acceptance.
