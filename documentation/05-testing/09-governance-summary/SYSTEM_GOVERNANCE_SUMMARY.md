# MatrixGin — System Governance Summary

This document is the single-source mental model
for governing the MatrixGin system.

It summarizes how the system is protected,
evolved, and kept coherent over time.


## 1. What MatrixGin Is

MatrixGin is a human-centric decision-support platform.

- Humans create value and make decisions.
- MatrixGin analyzes, advises, and optimizes.
- AI never replaces human authority.


## 2. Non-Negotiable Laws

MatrixGin operates under immutable laws:

1. Strategic invariants must never be violated.
2. Architecture has strict boundaries.
3. Contracts override implementations.
4. Behavior matters more than code.
5. No shortcut justifies governance bypass.


## 3. Validation Hierarchy

System correctness is validated top-down:

1. Strategic intent
2. Architectural form
3. Contracts
4. Functional behavior
5. Technical correctness

Lower layers never compensate higher ones.


## 4. Change Admission Rules

No change enters the system without gates:

- Merge gates protect integrity.
- Release gates protect production.
- Outsource gates protect boundaries.

Urgency never overrides gates.


## 5. Outsourcing Philosophy

Outsourcing is treated as a controlled operation.

- Scope is fixed.
- Forbidden zones are explicit.
- Acceptance is formal.
- Responsibility is never externalized.


## 6. Ongoing Governance

System integrity is maintained via:
- weekly architect checkups,
- sprint-level reflection,
- immediate response to red flags.

Governance is continuous, not episodic.


## 7. Final Principle

MatrixGin must remain:
- understandable,
- auditable,
- governable.

If a change makes the system harder to explain,
it is likely incorrect.
