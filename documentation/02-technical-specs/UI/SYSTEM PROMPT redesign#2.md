Design a calm, professional, non-intrusive ERP web interface for a system called “MatrixGin”.

TECH CONTEXT (MANDATORY):
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript
- UI Library: Ant Design v6 (primary component base)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (layout, spacing, responsiveness)
- Icons: Ant Design Icons + Lucide
- Design must be fully compatible with Ant Design theming and design tokens.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Create a non-annoying, non-flashy, corporate ERP interface suitable for 6–10 hours of daily professional work.

ABSOLUTE DESIGN RESTRICTIONS:
- NO dark-first UI
- NO heavy gradients, neon colors, glassmorphism, or glow
- NO bold-heavy typography
- NO “crypto / gaming / startup landing” aesthetics
- NO visual drama or decorative elements without function

VISUAL STYLE:
- Light or neutral background (off-white, warm gray)
- High contrast through spacing and hierarchy, not color aggression
- Subtle borders instead of shadows
- Very restrained accent color usage
- Corporate SaaS / ERP / Internal Tool aesthetic

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Use clean sans-serif fonts compatible with Ant Design defaults
- Mostly regular / medium weights
- Emphasize hierarchy via spacing, size, and layout — NOT boldness
- Comfortable line height for long reading

LAYOUT SYSTEM:
- Left vertical sidebar navigation with MANY items
- Sidebar must feel lightweight and non-overloaded
- Use:
  - Collapsible menu groups
  - Icons + short labels
  - Visual grouping instead of separators
- Sidebar should visually recede, not dominate

CONTENT AREA:
- Clean modular layout
- Ant Design cards, tables, forms — styled minimally
- Generous spacing (Tailwind-based)
- Clear scanning paths
- Designed for decision-making, not visual impressiveness

DASHBOARD PRINCIPLES:
- Information density without clutter
- Calm widgets (analytics, tasks, training, finance)
- Clear titles, muted subtitles
- No unnecessary animations

DESIGN SYSTEM ORIENTATION:
- Must feel like a refined Ant Design theme, not a custom art UI
- Use Ant Design tokens:
  - Border radius: small / subtle
  - Shadows: minimal or none
  - Colors: muted, neutral, enterprise-safe
- Tailwind used ONLY for layout, spacing, and responsiveness

UX VALUES:
- Low cognitive load
- Predictable behavior
- Professional restraint
- “This system respects my attention”

TARGET USER PERCEPTION:
- Calm
- Trust
- Control
- Efficiency
- No irritation

DELIVERABLE SCREENS:
- Main dashboard
- Sidebar navigation (expanded & collapsed)
- Example analytics card
- Example table (Ant Design style)
- Example form
