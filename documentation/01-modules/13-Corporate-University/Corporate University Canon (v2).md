# 📐 Module 13 — Corporate University

## Architectural Canon (v2.2)

**Status:** CANONICAL / NON-OPTIONAL
**Purpose:** Define the mandatory architectural logic of the Corporate University as a deterministic system of admission and development, not a course catalog.

---

## 1. Core Principle

The Corporate University is a **two-layer deterministic system**:

1. **FOUNDATIONAL LAYER** — admission and work eligibility (norms, laws, contracts)
2. **APPLIED LAYER** — development and growth inside the system (skills, performance)

These layers are **not equal**, **not interchangeable**, and **not optional**.

> Access to work, Applied learning, KPI, motivation, and status growth is impossible without acceptance of the Foundational Layer.

---

## 2. Layer A — FOUNDATIONAL (Admission / Eligibility Layer)

### 2.1 Role

The Foundational Layer defines the **deterministic base of the system**:

* moral and ethical laws
* operational laws of value creation
* role contracts and responsibility
* motivation consequences
* boundaries of acceptable behavior

This layer answers the question:

> **“Can this person legally and logically operate inside the system?”**

It does **not** teach skills.
It establishes **eligibility to work**.

---

### 2.2 Composition (Mandatory Core)

All elements below are **required for everyone without exception**:

1. **Internal Constitution** — moral, ethical, and organizational laws
2. **Unified Company Codex** — rules of direct action, prohibitions, sanctions
3. **Golden Standard (GSF) — CORE** — operational philosophy and priority of value over waste
4. **Role Model CORE (MDR Base)** — role as a contract, CQP, responsibility, KPI logic
5. **Role Motivation CORE** — motivation and penalty system tied to role behavior

Without acceptance of **all five elements**, participation in work and learning is prohibited.

---

### 2.3 Learning Model

Type:

* Foundational / Normative / Deterministic

Characteristics:

* immersion instead of training
* acceptance instead of exams
* reflection instead of drills
* deterministic outcome

Assessment model:

* **ACCEPTED / NOT ACCEPTED**
* no scores
* no percentages
* no gamified rewards

---

### 2.4 Blocking / Gating Logic

If **NOT ACCEPTED**, the system blocks:

* execution of any role
* enrollment into Applied disciplines
* KPI calculation
* motivation and reward accrual
* status growth
* access to management tracks

This block is **architectural and deterministic**, not discretionary.

---

### 2.5 Output of the Layer

The result of the Foundational Layer is:

* legal eligibility to work
* acceptance of system laws
* activation of role contract

Not a certificate.
Not a skill.

---

## 3. Layer B — APPLIED (Development Layer)

### 3.1 Role

The Applied Layer exists to:

* develop operational and managerial skills
* improve performance
* increase economic results
* grow authority and responsibility

This layer answers the question:

> **“How effective can this person become after admission?”**

---

### 3.2 Composition

Applied disciplines include:

* Golden Standard applications (by function and role)
* KPI & Economy
* Sales
* Production
* Management
* Role-specific MDR deep dives

All Applied content assumes prior Foundational acceptance.

---

### 3.3 Learning Model

Type:

* Applied / Operational

Methodology:

* Andragogy
* Outcomes-Based Education (OBE)
* Competency-Based Learning (CBL)
* 70:20:10

Assessment:

* skill demonstration
* on-the-job performance
* deterministic pass / fail by criteria

---

### 3.4 Access Rules

Access to Applied Layer requires:

* Foundational Layer = **ACCEPTED**

Within the Applied Layer:

* disciplines may have internal prerequisites
* progression is role- and status-dependent

---

### 3.5 Output of the Layer

Results of the Applied Layer:

* skill growth
* KPI improvement
* status advancement
* economic impact

---

## 4. Canonical Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Foundational Layer precedes Applied Layer
2. Foundational acceptance is mandatory for work eligibility
3. No KPI, motivation, or status without Foundational acceptance
4. Constitution, Codex, GSF CORE, Role Model CORE, and Role Motivation CORE are **laws**, not courses
5. The University is a **deterministic system of admission and development**, not content storage

---

## 5. Architectural Implications

This canon requires:

* discipline typing: `foundational | applied`
* bundle-based Foundational acceptance
* learning gate enforcement at backend level
* audit logging of acceptance and versions
* separation of normative and applied assessment models

---

## 6. Versioning

* v1 — flat course catalog
* v2 — gated two-layer university
* **v2.2 — deterministic admission with role and motivation contracts (this document)**

Any deviation from this canon is considered an architectural violation.
